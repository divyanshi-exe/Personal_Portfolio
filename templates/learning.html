              Discussion (GD) is a structured form of discussion used to
              evaluate participants on communication skills, teamwork,
              leadership, critical thinking, and awareness of current issues.
              GDs can be of various types such as topic-based (factual,
              abstract, or controversial), case-based, or task-oriented. To
              perform well, one should be well-informed, confident, and
              respectful during the discussion. Do's in a GD include staying
              relevant, listening actively, speaking clearly, and encouraging
              others, while don’ts include interrupting, dominating the
              discussion, or going off-topic. Generating ideas in a GD can be
              easier if you break the topic into parts (social, economic,
              political), use examples, and apply frameworks like SWOT
              (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) or PESTLE
              (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)
              for structured thinking.

              <span class="label-blue">Presentation</span><br />Participating in
              the SpeedTrack shoe pitch presentation was a memorable and
              confidence-building experience for me. Working with my teammates
              to create a strong, marketable pitch helped me understand the
              power of collaboration and clear communication. During the
              presentation, I had the opportunity to speak in front of an
              audience, explain our product features, and persuade listeners
              about what made SpeedTrack shoes unique. This challenged me to
              improve my voice modulation, body language, and clarity of
              thought. I also learned how to handle pressure while staying
              composed and professional. As a result, this experience
              significantly improved my verbal ability, enhanced my public
              speaking confidence, and taught me how to deliver messages with
              impact—skills that are essential for both academic
              and career success.
