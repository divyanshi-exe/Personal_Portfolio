            This quote stands out because it's the central message of the movie.
            It encourages students—and all of us—to live fully, make bold
            choices, and not be confined by societal expectations. It reminds me
            that time is fleeting, and we should make the most of every
            opportunity.

          <p>
            Dead Poets Society is a beautifully crafted film that explores the
            clash between conformity and individuality in a strict boarding
            school. Robin Williams shines as Mr. Keating, an English teacher who
            inspires his students to think for themselves and embrace poetry,
            creativity, and self-expression. The emotional depth, strong
            performances, and poetic storytelling make it a timeless classic.
            The film made me reflect on the importance of passion in education
            and the courage it takes to stand up for your beliefs.

              <strong>Communication and Self-Expression:</strong> Just as we
              learn about expressing ideas clearly, the movie emphasizes the
              power of words and poetry.

            <li>
              <strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Mr. Keating encourages the
              boys to analyze literature deeply and form their own
              interpretations—similar to what we’re taught in language and
              humanities classes.

            <li>
              <strong>Moral Courage:</strong> The film connects to ethical

            <li>
              <strong>Leadership and Influence:</strong> Mr. Keating’s
              leadership style shows how influence can be positive and
              transformative, tying into discussions from psychology or
              leadership studies.
